## Features

- **Course Explorer:** Explore courses offered at the University of Florida
    - Find courses by *course code*, *title*, or *instructor*
- **Course Selections:** Make multiple courses selections with backup options.
    - Pick which classes you want (and remove which sections you don't)
- **Schedule Generator:** View and compare all the possible schedules and pick the one that fits your needs and wants.
    - View color-coded schedules that show what your day-to-day ~~struggle~~ workload will be

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have `Node.js and npm` installed to download packages from the npm registry.

To check if a version of Node.js and npm is already installed:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```
If not installed, there are two types of installations and either works: 

- Node version manager
    - Can switch between versions of Node.js and npm
- Node installer
    - Access only to the set version of Node.js and npm

Read more and install here: [Node.js and npm doc link](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#windows-node-version-managers)

### Setup

#### Clone the Repo

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Install the Dependencies

Enter the web-app directory (`/app`) and install the dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, etc.):

```shell
cd app
npm install
```

### Usage:

- In the web-app (`/app`) directory:
    - **Development:** Run `npm run dev` to run the development server locally (with hot reloading).
    - **Production:** Run `npm run build` to build the app to `/app/dist`.

## Contribution

Before you can make good contributions, you need to know a little bit about what we're using and how the web-app (`/app`) works.
After that, you should be ready to get your hands dirty!

### What We're Using (our Tech Stack)

This project is built using a variety of exciting technologies, including:

- **TypeScript:** The JavaScript programming language with a typing system (for `Course` objects, etc.)
    - Familiarize yourself with [TypeScript‚Äôs documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to understand the
      basics and best practices.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
    - The [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a great resource for learning
      about component-based architecture and state management.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
    - Review the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for understanding utility-first styling and
      theming.
- **Vite:** Simply used as a build tool and development server.
    - Learn how to set up, configure, and use Vite from [Vite‚Äôs official guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

### How It All Works

Be sure to read (yes, read) some of our code. Everything works better when we all understand what we're talking about.

Simple breakdown of the web-app (`/app`):

- **public** (`/app/public`)
    - Holds images
- **src** (`/app/src`)
    - **components** (`/app/src/components`)
        - UI components that can be used across the React application
    - **constants** (`/app/src/constants`)
        - Contants layer of the application that defines and manages all the constants in the project
    - **scripts** (`/app/src/scripts`)
        - Holds the api information and SOC folder
    - **index.css** (`/app/src/index.css`)
        - Calls on Tailwind CSS
    - **main.tsx** (`/app/src/main.tsx`)
        - Where the application is setup and initialized
- **configuration files/package.json/index.html**
    - Used for configuring technologies used in this project, installing dependencies, and setting up the basic structure of the web-page respectively

[SwampScheduler's documentation](https://docs.ufosc.org/docs/swamp-scheduler) is a work-in-progress.

### Give Me Something To Do!

There are lots of things that can be done, and a lot of them are on our back-burner.

Take a look at what [issues (enhancements, bug fixes, and ideas)](https://github.com/ufosc/SwampScheduler/issues) are
open. If you find one you like, assign yourself and
be sure to talk to other people about what you're doing (it helps us, the [maintainers](#Maintainers) best allocate our
