## Contribution

Before you can make good contributions, you need to know a little bit about what we're using and how the web-app works.
After that, you should be ready to get your hands dirty!

### What We're Using (our Tech Stack)

This project is built using a variety of exciting technologies, including:

- **TypeScript:** The JavaScript programming language with a typing system (for `Course` objects, etc.)
    - Familiarize yourself with [TypeScript‚Äôs documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to understand the
      basics and best practices.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
    - The [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a great resource for learning
      about component-based architecture and state management.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
    - Review the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for understanding utility-first styling and
      theming.
- **Vite:** Simply used as a build tool and development server.
    - Learn how to set up, configure, and use Vite from [Vite‚Äôs official guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

### How It All Works

Be sure to read (yes, read) some of our code. Everything works better when we all understand what we're talking about.

[SwampScheduler's documentation](https://docs.ufosc.org/docs/swamp-scheduler) is a work-in-progress.

### Give Me Something To Do!

There are lots of things that can be done, and a lot of them are on our back-burner.
